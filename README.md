# ROS1-2d-mapping-navigation
Developed a full ROS1 pipeline for 2D mapping and navigation, using laser scan fusion and the gmapping SLAM algorithm to generate an occupancy grid map, followed by Stage simulation and a tuned navigation stack (DWA, AMCL) for localization and autonomous collision-free path planning.
